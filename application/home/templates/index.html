        <p>
            Hello world! Thank you for visiting this little website. It is a small-scale-but-fully-featured project that I am building using Flask,
            Bootstrap, and other tools in the Python web development stack. Its main purpose is to be a living document of
            my explorations in the world of web dev, an exercise to consolidate what I've been learning.
        </p>
        <p>
            While the creation of this website is supposed to be a learning project in and of itself, the finished app
            can hopefully also be useful as a learning tool. It will allow the website users to create their own
            personal flash card collection and interactively learn its contents wherever they are. The only thing needed
            is an internet connection and an up-to-date browser.

        <h2>How to use it?</h2>
    </div>
    <div>
        <p>Usage of the app is very simple:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Start by registering yourself as a user <a href="{{ url_for('auth.register') }}">here</a> and log into the app.
            </li>
            <li>
                Under the 'Cards' tab, you can create and manage your personal card collection. Add a few cards there via the
                interactive web form.
            </li>
            <li>
                The 'Learn' tab allows you to study the contents of the flash cards. You will be presented
                with a random card from your collection, for which you then indicate if you know it or not by clicking
                the check or cross buttons. You can flip the card by tapping it.
            </li>
            <li>
                The app keeps track of which cards you have marked as known or unknown, and increases or decreases their
                level accordingly. Higher-level cards will be presented for review after longer time intervals, to
                increase the learning difficulty.
            </li>
            <li>
                Under your 'Profile' tab, you can manage your account and obtain some statistics of your learning
                performance.
            </li>
        </ol>
