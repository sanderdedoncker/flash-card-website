Learning rules based on the "spaced repetition" concept. See
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaced_repetition
Learning with feedback (restudying after a failure) also improves performance.
For long-term retention, longer absolute spacing between tests is shown to improve performance, while relative spacing
has no significant effect:
Karpicke, J.D., Roediger, H.L. Is expanding retrieval a superior method for learning text materials?.
Memory & Cognition 38, 116â€“124 (2010).
Still, to avoid being overloaded with cards, the schedule here is based on the Leitner system. The repetition
period depends on a certain retention level, which is increased or decreased after a successful or
unsuccessful recall.
